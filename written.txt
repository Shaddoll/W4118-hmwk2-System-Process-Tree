a. Run your test program several times. Which fields in the prinfo structure change? Which ones do not? Discuss why different fields might change with different frequency.
	1. Every time we run the test program, the pid of the test and the first_child_pid of the parent of test changes. Because every time the test runs, it's a different process from the previous test. Therefore, the pid of test will probably be different every time. The parent of test only has one child, so the first_child_pid field of the parent changes as the pid of test changes.
	2. Occasionally, the state of some processes may change, but this situation is pretty rare. Some processes may be blocked and waiting for some event to occur at some certain point of time. However, because we are not doing anything on the emulator, such changes to the state is not common.
	3. Other fields like comm, parent_pid, next_sibling_pid, uid do not change at all. This is because there is no user interference, and the system remains stable after starting. Therefore, these fields do not change.
